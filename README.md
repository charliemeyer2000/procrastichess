This is a chess neural network i'm challenging myself to make instead of studying for my linear algebra exam

Never done this before (both doing a chess engine and coding a neural network) so we'll see how this goes.

I guess this counts as studying? maybe? Idk something something linear algebra matrix multiplication

## How this works

This is a neural network for the value function for a chess engine. Currently training off of a dataset of 60k games 
from a CSV i found, but also supplied a PGN loader in case you want to load from PGN's (highly suggest lichess). For a model to train within a reasonable time frame, 

Run the `train.py` method after downloading and extracting data to the proper path (that you can specify!), and then run the outputted model.

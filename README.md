This is a chess neural network i'm challenging myself to make instead of studying for my linear algebra exam

I guess this counts as studying? maybe? 

## How this works

This is a neural network for the value function for a chess engine. I first did this off of 60k games from a CSV, but switched to using games from [Lichess](https://database.lichess.org/) to quickly load games using PGN format. 

Run the `train.py` method after downloading and extracting data to the proper path (that you can specify!), and then run the outputted model.

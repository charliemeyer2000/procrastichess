# Procrastichess

This is a chess neural network i'm challenging myself to make instead of studying for my linear algebra exam

I guess this counts as studying? maybe? 

# Setup

This [paper](Thesis_Matthia_Sabatelli.pdf) suggests 8x8x12 which seems shitty but oh well. I think i use 8x8x14 to encode also en passant and castling

# things

uppercase pieces are white, lowercase are black.
